His understanding of the vice presidency was heavily influenced by Vice President Walter Mondale, who did not enjoy a strong relationship with President Carter in part because of his confrontations with senior staff and Cabinet members, and by Vice President Nelson Rockefeller's difficult relationship with some members of the White House staff during the Ford administration. The Bushes attended a large number of public and ceremonial events in their positions, including many state funerals, which became a common joke for comedians.
