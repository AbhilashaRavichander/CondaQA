In the open ocean, though there is a background, the principal methods of camouflage are transparency, silvering, and countershading, while the ability to produce light is among other things used for counter-illumination on the undersides of cephalopods such as squid. Some animals, such as chameleons and octopuses, are capable of actively changing their skin pattern and colours, whether for camouflage or for signalling. It is possible that some plants use camouflage to evade being eaten by herbivores.", "sentence2": "Might a picture of the open ocean show a complex pattern?", "label": "YES"}

The inner membrane is home to around 1/5 of the total protein in a mitochondrion. Additionally, the inner membrane is rich in the usual levels of the phospholipid cardiolipin. This phospholipid was originally discovered in cow hearts in 1942, and is usually characteristic of mitochondrial and bacterial plasma membranes. Cardiolipin contains four fatty acids rather than two, and may help to make the inner membrane impermeable. Unlike the outer membrane, the inner membrane does not contain porins, and is highly impermeable to all molecules. Almost all ions and molecules require special membrane transporters to enter or exit the matrix. Proteins are ferried into the matrix via the translocase of the inner membrane (TIM) complex or via OXA1L. In addition, there is a membrane potential across the inner membrane, formed by the action of the enzymes of the electron transport chain. Inner membrane fusion is mediated by the inner membrane protein OPA1.", "sentence2": "If you took a random sample of comparable inner membranes from a variety of different animals in the same basic class, would you expect the majority of these membranes to contain cardiolipin to some degree?", "label": "YES"}
